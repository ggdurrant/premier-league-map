# premier-league-map
mapping the nationalities of PL players

## Plan
The plan is to create interactive and/or snapshot maps of the nationalities of players in England's Premier League. Given taht the Premier League is recognized as one of the top leagues in the world for football players, it draws players from all over the globe. It would be interesting to visualize where these players come from and identify if any trends change over time. I also want to play with the geospatial population density maps - this could be done by seeing what towns players come from in a country. 

## Data
Going to start with getting data from FBRef, since it can be easily downloaded as CSV files instead of web scraping.
